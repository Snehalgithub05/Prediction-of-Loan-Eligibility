# Prediction-of-Loan-Eligibility
What is Prediction of Loan Eligibility? : Loan eligibility means the set of criteria basis which a financial institution evaluates to decide the eligibility of a customer for a particular loan. In this project we have to predict whether the person is eligible for the loan according to the given criteria, where the criteria are the Gender, Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Property Area, etc. of the Applicant.

Data Description: The source of this data is Kaggle.com. This loan data contains 614 rows and 13 columns. In this data there are various eligibility criteria are given like, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Dependents, Applicant Income, Property Area, Self Employed, Loan Amount, etc. 

Objective:  1. To predict whether the applicants are eligible for loan or not, according to given eligibility criteria.  
2. And to check which Machine Learning algorithm is good fit for this loan data.

Conclusion:  According this I have concluded that the Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes Classification these algorithms of machine learning are good fit for this data as compare to Decision Tree Classification algorithm. Because the accuracy score of logistic regression and naïve bayes is 82% and the accuracy of decision tree classifier is 74%.
